As part of the study "Public services and digital government during the pandemic Perspectives of Citizens, Civil Servants and Government Institutions" a nationally representative telephone survey was conducted between July and August 2020 to 10,207 adult citizens from Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. 

The survey included a limited set of questions on procedures before and during the pandemic, future prospects, and citizens' views on personal data.
