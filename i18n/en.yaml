From the research carried out, 12 countries with personal data protection laws in force were detected Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico (with two laws), Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. Even though Barbados and Jamaica, have their laws approved by parliament, both are pending enactment and, therefore, also pending entry into force. Although Chile has a privacy law that partially regulates a series of components in the area of personal data, it is not a specialized legislation on the subject. As for the Dominican Republic, the legislation has a sectoral scope, so it does not qualify as a cross-cutting legislation on the subject.

- id: home_label_there_is_a_lack_of_knowledge_description
  translation: 51% of respondents to the question "Do you find that sharing your personal data has more benefits than risks?" with "More risks than benefits" (left axis), agreed with the question "Should the government fine people who are COVID19 positive and do not allow geolocation of their cell phones?"

(left axis) answered Yes to the question "Can the government provide benefits by collecting your and other people's data to overcome potential risks in times of pandemic?" (right axis). The willingness to hand over this information to the state without the need to know what is being done with it may reflect that these individuals do not find value in their personal data.
